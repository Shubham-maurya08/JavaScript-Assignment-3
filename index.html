    <h4>Q1. What are the differences between var, let and const?</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Ans: var:(Global Scope)</b>
        It can be declare in a line and then initialized with a value in another lines and also declare and initialized
        in the same line.
        It can be redecalred but can be re-initialized and we can not assign variable same name in var keyword. <br>

        <b>let:(Local Scope)</b>
        It can be declare in a line and then initialized with a value in another lines and also declare and initialized
        in the same line.
        They can not be redecalred and but can be re-initialized.
        We can not have two variable with same name in let keyword. <br>

        <b>Const:(Local Scope)</b>
        They can be declared and initialized with a value in same line only. But can not be redecalred and cannot be
        re-initialized.
        We can not have two variable with same name in const keyword.
    </p><br>
    <h4>Q2. What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what?</h4>
    <p>
        Ans: Null is a special value that represents an empty or unknown value.
    <pre>
    <b>Example:</b>
    var test1 = null;
    console.log(test1);
</pre>

    Undefined means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not yet been defined.
    <pre>
        <b>Example:</b>
        var test2;
        console.log(test2);
    </pre>
    </p>

    <h4>Q3. What is use of prompt in JavaScript?</h4>
    <p>
        Ans: It's a inbuilt function which is used to display a dialog box that asks the user to input. This pop-up box
        will appear and takes user input before entering the web page. It waits until the user enters any value in the
        text box or we can also cancel the dialog box.
    </p>

    <h4>Q4. Why JavaScript is Dyanmic Language? Write the Code for all Data types.</h4>
    <p>
        Ans: JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that data types of variables are determined by the
        value
        they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them <br>
        There are two type of datatypes present in Javascript.
    <pre>
            1- Primitive Data Type
            2- Non-primitive Data Type
    
            Primitive Datatype consist of 5 different data type named -
            Number :- let a = 123
            String :- let b = "Hey Javascript"
            Boolean :- let c = true/false
            Undefined :- let d;
            Null :- let e = null
        
            Non-primitive datatype consist of 3 different data type named 
            Object :- {key : value}
            Array :- [12, 34, 56]
            Function :- function fun(){}
        </pre>
    </p>

    <h4>Q5. What are the uses of JavaScript Operators?</h4>
    <p>
        Ans: Operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations etc. There are different
        types of JavaScript operators:
    <pre>
            Arithmetic Operators
            Assignment Operators
            Comparison Operators
            Logical Operators
            Conditional Operators(ternary operator)
            Typeof Operators
            Bitwise Operators
        </pre>
    </p>

    <h4>Q6. Explain the Assignment Operator.</h4>
    <p>
        Ans: JavaScript assignment operator is equal (=) which assigns the value of the right-hand operand to its
        left-hand operand.
    </p>

    <h4>Q7. Explain the all Arithmetic Operators.</h4>
    <p>
        Ans: An arithmetic operator is a mathematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation
        between them.
    <pre>
            <b>There are 5 arithmetic operators:</b>

            Addition (+) Adds one operand to the other
            Subtraction (-) Subtracts the second operand from the first
            Multiplication (*) Multiplies one operand by the other
            Division (/) Divides the first operand by the second
            Modulo (%) Divides the first integer operand by the second, and returns the remainder
        </pre>
    </p>

    <h4>Q8. What are the Binary Operators in js.</h4>
    <p>
        Ans: A binary operator is an operator that operates on two operands and manipulates them to return a result.
        Binary operators are presented in the form: Operand1, Operator, Operand2<br>Some common binary operators in
        computing include:
    <pre>
            Equal (==)
            Not equal (!=)
            Less than (<)
            Greater than (>)
            Greater than or equal to (>=)
            Less than or equal to (<=)
            Logical AND (&&)
            Logical OR (||)
            Addition (+)
            Subtraction (-)
            Multiplication (*)
            Divide (/)
            Modulo (%)
        </pre>
    </p>

    <h4>Q9. Explain the Pre-Increment and Post Increment in js.</h4>
    <p>
        Ans: Pre-increment (++i) - Before assigning the value to the variable, the value is incremented by one.
    <pre>
            Ex :- let x = 3;
            let y = ++x;
            console.log(x) //it will give output 4 
            console.log(y) //it will give output 4.
    
    
            Post-increment (i++) - After assigning the value to the variable, the value is incremented. 
            Ex :- let x =3;
            let y = x++;
            console.log(x) //it will give output 4
            console.log(y) //it will give output 3
        </pre>
    </p>

    <h4>Q10. Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h4>
    <p>
        Ans: In javaScript == is used for comparing between two variable's value and === is used for comparing two variables as
        well as it checks their datatype.
